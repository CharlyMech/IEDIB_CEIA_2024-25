# Chapter 8: Leia Organa-Skywalker – The Daughter of Two Worlds

Leia’s datapad buzzed with yet another Senate alert. At 17, she was the youngest aide in Chancellor Mothma’s office, a role that demanded perfection. Her mother’s legacy loomed large—holos of Padmé’s speeches lined the walls, and whispers of “nepotism” followed Leia through the Rotunda’s corridors. But her father’s shadow was darker. Anakin Skywalker’s redemption was legendary, yet some senators still eyed his family with suspicion. “Organa-Skywalker,” a Kuati delegate sneered. “A name that hedges bets.”

Her breaking point came during a debate over Corellia’s separatist movement. Leia, channeling Padmé’s eloquence, argued for sanctions over sanctions. But when Anakin entered the gallery, his presence ignited protests. “Jedi have no place in politics!” someone shouted. That night, Leia confronted him at the Jedi Temple. “Why did you come? You ruined everything!” Anakin’s reply was gentle. “I wanted to see my daughter.” Their argument ended with Leia igniting his old lightsaber—a gift he’d never given her—and slashing a training dummy to pieces.

Her rebellion took shape on Lothal, where she joined Ahsoka’s enclave incognito. Disguised as a mechanic, she learned to channel her fury into the Force. But when a Mandalorian extremist group bombed a peace summit, Leia’s cover blew mid-rescue. Holofeeds hailed her as “the Jedi Princess,” a title she detested. Returning to Coruscant, she forged a compromise: Corellia would retain autonomy in exchange for disarming its fleet. Padmé’s tears at the signing ceremony confused her—until her mother whispered, “I was afraid you’d lost yourself to my example.”

Leia’s final test came on Mustafar. Sent to negotiate with a rogue mining guild, she discovered their leader was her childhood friend, Sabe, Padmé’s former decoy. “Your family’s ‘peace’ starves worlds like mine!” Sabe hissed. Leia, unarmed, offered her own japor snippet necklace. “My mother taught me that symbols matter. But actions matter more.” The guild stood down. That night, Leia wrote in her journal: I am not my parents. I am their hope.
