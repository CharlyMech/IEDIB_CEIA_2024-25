# Chapter 6: Captain Rex & the 501st – The Legion Reborn

CT-7567—Rex—no longer needed his helmet to hide his face. The Clone Wars’ end had gifted him a new identity: Marshal of the Outer Rim Peacekeepers. The 501st, once the tip of the Republic’s spear, now patrolled sectors like Ryloth and Pantora, their armor repainted in azure and gold. But not all adjusted to peace. Jesse, haunted by nightmares of inhibitor chips, retired to a quiet farm on Saleucami. Hardcase opened a weapons shop on Nar Shaddaa, his boisterous laugh masking his guilt over Umbara.

Rex’s true trial came when a band of clones, led by a disillusioned Dogma, seized a Venator-class star destroyer near Kamino. “We were bred to fight!” Dogma transmitted. “What are we now?!” Rex boarded the ship alone, unarmed. In the reactor core, he found Dogma clutching a thermal detonator. “You’re right,” Rex said. “We’re more than soldiers. We’re brothers.” Dogma’s surrender made headlines, but Rex’s insomnia worsened.

Anakin visited him on Mandalore, where Rex had been negotiating with Bo-Katan’s forces. “You don’t have to carry this alone,” Anakin said, handing him a datapad—a bill proposing clone citizenship. Rex’s tears fogged his visor. “It’s not enough,” he muttered. “But it’s a start.”

The chapter closed with the 501st’s final mission: dismantling a Separatist bio-weapon lab on Geonosis. Among the freed prisoners was a young girl named Omega, whose DNA held the key to cloning’s future. Rex, sensing her importance, swore to protect her—even as the lab’s self-destruct sequence lit up the Geonosian sky.
