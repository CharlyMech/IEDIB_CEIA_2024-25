# Chapter 9: Luke Skywalker – The Heir of the Force

Luke’s X-wing skimmed the dunes of Jakku, his astromech, T7, beeping anxiously. The mission was straightforward: recover a Sith artifact before scavengers did. But the Force screamed danger. At 19, Luke was the most gifted Padawan of his generation, yet Anakin’s training oscillated between overprotective and obsessive. “You’re not ready for the trials,” his father had said that morning. Now, stranded in a sandstorm, Luke understood why.

The artifact—a holocron sealed by Revan—had lured him into a trap. Tusken Raiders, manipulated by a hooded figure, ambushed him. Disarming them with the Force, Luke faced their puppeteer: a Nightsister named Merrin, her eyes blazing green. “Your father’s victory was an accident,” she taunted. “The Sith endure.” Their duel raged through a buried Star Destroyer, Luke’s green blade clashing against her crimson magic. When she summoned the spirits of dead Sith, Luke did the unthinkable: he listened.

The vision struck like lightning. He saw Anakin kneeling before Palpatine, the galaxy in flames—a timeline that never was. “Your father’s weakness spared us,” hissed Darth Bane’s specter. “You will not.” Luke’s scream shattered the holocron, its dark energy searing his right hand. Merrin fled, but not before warning, “This is a beginning, Skywalker.”

Returning to Coruscant, Luke hid his injury with a glove, ashamed. But Anakin sensed the truth. In a rare moment of vulnerability, he shared his own failure: the Tusken massacre. “The dark side isn’t a choice,” Anakin said. “It’s a voice that never stops. But you can choose to hear another.” Together, they constructed Luke’s new lightsaber—a gold-bladed weapon symbolizing balance.

The chapter closed with Luke volunteering for a mission to Exegol, where rumors of Sith cults festered. As his X-wing launched, Anakin whispered, “He’s ready.” Obi-Wan, standing beside him, replied, “Let’s hope the galaxy is.”
