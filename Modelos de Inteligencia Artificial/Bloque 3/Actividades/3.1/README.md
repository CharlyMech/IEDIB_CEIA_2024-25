# Evaluated task CE_5071 3.1

Evaluated task for AI models subject, Block 3.

### Implement an expert system in Python using [CLIPSPY](https://pypi.org/project/clipspy/).

For this exercise I will be taking the kind of physical activity from a person and giving some advices depending on its goal.

#### How to use

Assuming that Python and pip are installed in your computer and you copied this directory's content:

-  Create a virtual environment and activate it (not necessary but recommended):

```bash
cd [directory with the content]
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

-  Install the required libraries (`pip` or `pip3`, depending on your Python's version):

```bash
pip3 install requirements.txt
```

_NOTICE_ that the `requirements.txt` file containes more packages than needed for this script, the reason why is because there are also libraries and packages required for the task's notebook. This is completely correct.

-  Execute the script (`py` or `python` would be needed instead of the following one depending on your OS):

```bash
python3 main.py
```
